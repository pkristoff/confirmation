<p>Welcome <%= @resource.candidate_sheet.first_name  %>  <%= @resource.candidate_sheet.last_name %>!</p>

<p>
  I am Vicki Kristoff and I track all the data/forms for the Confirmation Candidates.
I received your name from Liz Sams indicating that you will be going through Confirmation preparation this school year and be Confirmed in May 2018.
If this is not your plan, please email me and I will remove you from the list.
This year, all Confirmation information will be entered on line and/or uploaded by you.
If you are planning on being Confirmed, please click this link below.
</p>

<%= link_to 'Confirm my account', confirmation_url(@resource, confirmation_token: @token) %>

<p>
  You should have received a second email with a link that will allow you to enter a password. After setting your password,
  you will be able to login with your user name (shown at the bottom of this email) and password at any time and enter and upload your information.
</p>

<p>
Each month, you will receive an email with the status of your forms (called events on the website).  Also, you will be able to see this on the checklist screen after you login.
When you click on the highlighted event name, the screen will display what needs to be entered and if something needs to be uploaded.
On each screen, you can use the download document button if you want or need to print a hardcopy of the form.
For example, the sponsor covenant form needs to be filled out and signed by your sponsor. Once this is complete, you upload the document to the website.
There are instructions on each page for completing that event. Some events have to be completed AND a form needs to be uploaded.
For example, if you were NOT baptized at StMM, the baptismal certificate information needs to be entered and a copy of your baptismal certificate needs to be uploaded.
If you have any questions or need help, I can be reached at stmm.conmfirmation@kristoffs.com or 919-249-5629.

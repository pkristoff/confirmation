    I am committed to this year of preparation for Confirmation. I agree to attend all of the required sessions which include the Confirmation Retreat, Confirmation classes, Confirmation practice, and the Confirmation Mass. I will also attend at least one other Youth Group session per month.
    I will choose to participate in all sessions with an open heart and give 100% of myself to my small group and my small group leaders. I agree to cultivate a relationship with my sponsor to learn from their spiritual guidance.
    Most importantly, I promise to receive all that God has
    in store for me this year and to let the gifts and fruits of
    the Holy Spirit come alive in my life.
